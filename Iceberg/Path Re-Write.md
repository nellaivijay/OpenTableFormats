Apache Iceberg 1.8.0 introduced a significant feature known as Table Path Re-Write, which facilitates the migration of tables from one storage location to another while preserving the historical data attached to those tables. This feature simplifies the process of moving Iceberg tables from an on-premises environment (like HDFS) to cloud storage (like S3) without losing the table's metadata and version history.

### Overview of Table Path Re-Write

Previously, when migrating Iceberg tables, users would typically have to follow a lengthy method that involved copying files to a new storage location and creating new tables. This process would often result in the loss of historical data, which is crucial for many data use cases. The Table Path Re-Write feature addresses this gap by allowing a more seamless migration while maintaining the integrity of the table's history.

### How It Works

Here’s a breakdown of the process for migrating an Iceberg table using the Table Path Re-Write method:

1. **Run the `ReWritePath` Procedure**: This is the initial step where you invoke the Table Path Re-Write procedure within the Iceberg table. This procedure handles the logistics of moving data and updating paths.

2. **Copy Files**: Next, the Iceberg engine copies the existing table files from the original storage (e.g., HDFS) to the new designated location, such as an S3 bucket. The procedure ensures that files are efficiently transferred without any loss.

3. **Update Metadata**: After the files are transferred, the Iceberg table's metadata is updated to reflect the new location. This includes the file paths in the catalog, which now points to the cloud storage.

4. **Register the Table**: Once the files are copied and the metadata is updated, you can register the Table in your desired catalog, such as the Polaris catalog. This step makes the table accessible for querying and ensures that all users can find it under the new path.

5. **Validate the Data**: It’s critical to validate the data post-migration to ensure everything has moved over correctly and retains the same structure. This can be done through various queries or checks to compare the old and new locations.

### Benefits of Table Path Re-Write

- **Preservation of History**: One of the most significant advantages is the preservation of all historical data related to the Iceberg table, enabling time travel and versioning capabilities after migration.

- **Efficiency**: The process is designed to be more efficient than previous methods, reducing the manual steps involved in data migration.

- **Simplicity**: The simplicity of using a single procedure to handle the migration is a significant improvement, making it easier for users to migrate tables without extensive knowledge of the underlying complexities.

### Example Workflow

Suppose you have an Iceberg table located in HDFS that you want to move to S3. Here’s a simplified sequence:

1. Invoke the ReWritePath procedure:
   ```sql
   CALL system.rewrite_path('db_name.table_name', 's3://new-bucket/path/to/table');
   ```

2. Monitor the copying of files from HDFS to the S3 location.

3. After the completion of the copy, register the new table location in the Polaris catalog:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE new_table_name
   USING iceberg
   LOCATION 's3://new-bucket/path/to/table';
   ```

4. Validate the data by executing a simple select query:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM new_table_name LIMIT 10;
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively migrate your Iceberg table to a new cloud storage location while ensuring that your historical data remains intact and accessible.
