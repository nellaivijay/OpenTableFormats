Open Table formats - A Comparative Study
I would like to present a series of concise comparisons regarding the internals of different table formats. While I have offered detailed insights into each format, I believe itâ€™s valuable to highlight both their commonalities and distinctions. These comparisons will emphasize objective facts about their functionalities, steering clear of personal judgments or opinions. My aim is to foster a constructive dialogue rather than engage in debates about which table format may be preferable.

Disclaimer: I understand that the debate over Open Table formats can be quite contentious. My intention with any discussion about them is to remain objective and help foster a deeper understanding of the technology involved. I truly appreciate the passion behind these discussions!
